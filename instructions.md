## Using noStrudel

- Click `launch UI` to access your personal noStrudel client
- Create a new account or access an existing account by using a nip-07 browser extension. If creating a new account, be sure to securely back up the private key, preferably using Vaultwarden on your Start9 server
- Select the relays you want to use to browse nostr or use your existing relays from other nostr apps

## Using your local nostr relay (optional)

If you have Nostr RS Relay installed you can enable the "Use local relay for caching" option to use it as a cache.
However it must be set to "Public" mode. otherwise it will only cache your events
